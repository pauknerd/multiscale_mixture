Multiscale Homogenized Constrained Mixture Model

Code for a multiscale homogenized constrained mixture model described in the article: Paukner D., Humphrey, J. D., Cyron J. C. (2024). 'Multiscale homogenized constrained mixture mode of the bio-chemo-mechanics of soft tissue growth and remodeling.' Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology.

## Requirements

The model is based on the following open-source software packages with the tested versions in parentheses:
- [dealii](https://www.dealii.org/) (version 9.6.0)
- [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io/) (version 13.4.1)
- [SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials) (version 6.7)
